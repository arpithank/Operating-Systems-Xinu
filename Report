1.The program produces garbage values. This is because The processes, producer and consumer is asynchronous. The global variable that they share can be overwrittten at any time.

2. All the produced values are getting consumed. Even for small values like 10 or 20.

The functions in the project are-

producer() - used to produce the values
consumer() - used to consume the values
xsh_prodcons() - to run the shell cmd to execute the prodcuer consumer program

All functions and their prototypes, with header files were updated by both team members-
ranagara and arpkashy
